# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git would be the product (code) and gut hub is the amazon warhorse where it can be stored and shipped to whoever has access and a need for the product .

  Researched answer:Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

  The main Git vs GitHub difference is in their functionality. While they both provide source code management (SCM) and make merging and sharing code easier, this is pretty much where their similarities end. Think of Git as a single computer and GitHub as a network of multiple interconnected computers, all with the same end goal but a wildly different role for how to get there.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:Boolean value is boiled down to two values true or false if you can’t put them in one of the two containers it’s not a Boolean value.

  Researched answer:Traditionally, the result of a logical or Boolean expression is considered true if it evaluates to 1 and false if it evaluates to 0.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:The difference between index and value  is  and index gives you a measurement and a value is the amount of the measurement .

  Researched answer: An index is a numerical representation of an item's position in a sequence. Values are the values that comprise values like Booleans, Strings, arrays, numbers, etc. Its behavior is the same as other programming languages as values are possessing some definite properties which is being used as per the requirement and run time environment while executing the JavaScript.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:An iteration is code that is  a math problem.

  Researched answer:Sometimes an algorithm needs to repeat certain steps until told to stop or until a particular condition has been met. Iteration is the process of repeating steps.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:It’s an ideal way of programming because one person is driving (physically punching the code)and one person is navigating(is instructing the driver in essence the brains of the operation).And the fact there four eyes on the code it insures that simple mistakes minimized and a reduced mental fatigue.

  Researched answer:Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:The breakout groups were the most helpful personally because I learn the most in a one on one setting.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request:let you tell the people you collaborate with about updates you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

2. Higher Order Functions:Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. In simple words.

3. Jest:Jest is a JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

4. Objects:is a standalone entity, with properties and type.

5. Classes:A JavaScript class is a type of function. Classes are declared with the class keyword.
