// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

//var cohort = "Echo 2021"
 //console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer:Each letter will be on a different line.
// b) Verify and explain:The answer was 9 because the comand was length it determined thespaces the length was inside the parentheses.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

//var greeting = "Hello World!"
 //console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer:"l"
// b) Verify and explain:The number three inside of the square brakets will decide when we stop counting we end on the l .


// --------------------3) What will this log?

//var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
//var index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer:"JavaScript"
// b) Verify and explain:"Ruby" computers start counting with a zero I forgot the simple principle resulted in the wrong answer.


// --------------------4) What will this log?

//var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer:"SATURDAY","SUNDAY"
// b) Verify and explain:"weekendDays.ToUpperCase is not a function" the computer needs an understandabe code for it to work and these commands are Invalid


// --------------------5) What will this log?

//var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer:number
// b) Verify and explain:String is in parentheses, Boolean is true or false so i feel like the only logical answer is number.
